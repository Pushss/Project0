        Howdy, my name is Christopher "Push" Cameron.
        I'm a second year software development student.
        I'm mature student at the ripe age of 28 years old.
        My previous work experience varies from Janitorial to Call Center customer
        retentions and currently I'm performing a dual role as Safety Steward and
        Security Operitave for G4S events team in the UK. My current position
        comes with big responsibilties as well as privlidges. No two days are the
        same. One day I can be stage side for big act's such as Metallica, Stone Sour or Beyonce.
        The next I could be in London carrying out security for which ever festival is on that weekend.
        Although I'm currently working protecting the world. My true dream is to
        enhance and develop the world through code.
