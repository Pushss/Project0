        During my very limited free time, i enjoy spending time with my 2 boys
        and my partner. A day off work for my will generally consist of playing
        some video games or going out with my partner and kids to a park or
        somewhere cool for the kids. The largest part of my sparetime is taken
        up coding or reading some documentation.
